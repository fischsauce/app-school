### Q1. Which programming languages have you had previous experience with?  (You've at least done Hoon...)

C#
Go
Hoon
HTML/CSS
Java
Javascript
Lisp
Python
Visual Basic
Other: Kotlin,Ruby,


### Q2. Match the arm to its function.

++on-fail	Clean up after a crash.
++on-leave	Register a dropped subscriber.
++on-init	Creates and returns agent.
++on-load	Pack agent state for an upgrade.		
++on-agent	Allow read-only scry into agent state.
++on-peek	Handle one-time message.
++on-poke	Handle a subscription update.
++on-save	Update agent state after an upgrade.			
++on-watch	Register a new subscriber.
++on-arvo	Handles returned information from Arvo.		
++on-peek	Handle one-time message.	



### Q3. Modify either of the minimalist Gall agents to print the poke they receive using ~& sigpam.  (You don't need to process the poke data, just output it.)

Poke it at the command line using the :agent &noun notation.  Respond to this question with the result of that action.
*
At first I just recycled the default-agent's on-poke debug method:
```
++  on-poke
  |=  =noun
  ~&  >  "bravo received a poke with: {<noun>}"
  !!
```
... but the result was to print the input noun in it's raw form:
```
>   "bravo received a poke with: [1.853.189.998 [1.684.828.008 [1.701.998.435 [1.819.043.171 ... " 
```


Are you sure we don't need to process this in some way?


If I assign a variable name to the input:
```
  |=  =input=noun
  ~&  >  "bravo received a poke with: {<input>}"
  !!
```
...then I still get the raw input printed.

However, if I go back to `~& > "...{<noun>}"` - then I can get something a little more readable:
```
>   "bravo received a poke with: <1.kvs [* <139.uat 33.rnj 1.pnw %139>]>"
```
Is this the vase? This doesn't make sense to me. What is {<noun>} referring to here? Is it there another noun in the ++on-poke context? *


If I go back to the default-agent's method of using a cage:
```
  |=  input=cage
  ~&  >  "bravo received a poke with {<p.input>} and {<q.input>}"
  !!   
```
...then I'm getting closer to something sensibility:
```
>   "bravo received a poke with %noun and [#t/%~ q=0]"
```

* I think I answered my own question from earlier:
"""
The difference you're observing comes from the distinction between the data you're sending (`input` or `noun` in the code) and the implicit noun structure that Gall uses to wrap pokes, which contains not just the data but also metadata.
 
When you're referencing `input`, you're trying to print the entire structure of the poke (the full noun), which includes more than just the data you sentâ€”it also includes metadata about the poke itself. This is why you're seeing raw and unrecognizable data.

On the other hand, when you reference `noun` (in the context of an on-poke arm), you're actually referencing a part of the poke data that Gall has implicitly unwrapped for you.
